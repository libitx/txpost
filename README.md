Receive Bitcoin transactions over HTTP in a concise and efficient binary serialisation format.

Txpost implements a standard for encoding and decoding Bitcoin transactions and other data in a concise binary format using [CBOR](https://cbor.io). A number of modules following the Plug specification can easily be slotted in your Phoenix or Plug based application's pipeline. An optional Router module is available, allowing you to implement routing logic for different types of transactions from a single endpoint.

* Concise and efficient binary data serialisation format
* Send transactions over HTTP - faster and cheaper
* Simple and flexible schema for transferring Bitcoin transations with arbitrary data parameters
* Send single or multiple transactions in one request
* Sign and verify data payloads with ECDSA signatures

### BRFC specifications

Txpost is an implementation of the following BRFC specifications. They describe a standard for serialising Bitcoin transactions and associated parameters, along with arbitrary meta data, in a concise binary format using CBOR:

* BRFC `c9a2975b3d19` - [CBOR Tx Payload specification](https://github.com/libitx/txpost/blob/master/brfc-specs/cbor-tx-payload.md)
* BRFC `5b82a2ed7b16` - [CBOR Tx Envelope specification](https://github.com/libitx/txpost/blob/master/brfc-specs/cbor-tx-envelope.md)

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `txpost` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:txpost, "~> 0.1"}
  ]
end
```

Add `Txpost.Parsers.CBOR` to your endpoint's list of parsers.

```elixir
plug Plug.Parsers,
  parsers: [
    :json,
    Txpost.Parsers.CBOR
  ]
```

Finally create any routes needed to handle transaction requests and add `Txpost.Plug` to the plug pipeline. For example, adding a route to a Phoenix router:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.Router do
  use MyAppWeb, :router

  pipeline :tx_api do
    plug :accepts, ["cbor"]
    plug Txpost.Plug
  end

  scope "/tx" do
    pipe_through :tx_api
    post "/create", MyAppWeb.TxController, :create
  end
end
```

For detailed examples, refer to the [full documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/txpost).

## Transaction routing

The example above creates a single route passing all transactions to the same controller. You could create many routes for different transactions but in some applications it may be desirable to advertise a single endpoint to receive different types of transactions, each handled by different controllers. In this case `Txpost.Router` can be used to route transactions to different controllers, using any logic you need.

A tx router is a module that implements the `Txpost.Router.handle_tx/2` callback.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.TxRouter do
  use Txpost.Router

  def handle_tx(conn, _params) do
    case get_req_meta(conn) do
      %{"type" => "article"} -> ArticleController.call(conn, :create)
      %{"type" => "image"} -> ImageController.call(conn, :create)
    end
  end
end
```
